# Blinkit Sales Analysis Capstone Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive sales analysis of Blinkit (a quick-commerce grocery platform) using data science and BI techniques. The goal is to derive business insights from Blinkit’s grocery sales data — analyzing sales trends, customer behavior, and outlet performance — and present them via a Power BI dashboard.

## 🔍 Business Objectives

1. Understand Blinkit’s overall sales performance: total sales volume, average sale per transaction, and number of items.
2. Analyze customer satisfaction using average item ratings.
3. Explore how different item attributes (like fat content or product category) affect sales.
4. Compare outlet performance by:

   * Outlet type (supermarket, grocery store, etc.)
   * Outlet size
   * Outlet location tier
   * Outlet establishment year
5. Generate actionable insights for Blinkit stakeholders (e.g., which outlet types to focus on, popular product segments, and customer preferences).
